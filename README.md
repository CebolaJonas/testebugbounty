# RCC System

This is a project I developed in mid to late 2018 to manage a organization in the Habbo game.

It is built with a server side application using Node.js and the AdonisJs framework. It is a server side rendered application.

The database is PostgreSQL, but mostly all queries were coded using the Knex query builder.

Though this is a very nice project it was never published. No new major changes were made since its creation, i.e. the project is mostly archived.
